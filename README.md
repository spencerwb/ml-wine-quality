# ml-wine-quality

In order to succeed and profit in this highly competitive market, it is crucial for wine producers to have a detailed understanding of its product's quality. As a result, we aim to use machine learning algorithms to explore and identify the relationships between wine's quality and its various attributes.


Google Colaboratory was the integrated development environment used for this project. You can find the Google Colab notebook [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sfvu1w5Ow20lMgo9_BpVTMQtn7kkOIoF/view?usp=sharing).

See report_checkpoint.pdf for a more detailed description of the project.
